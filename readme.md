Keep track of my learning material for Machine Learning, Stanford, given by Andrew Ng.

The material includes the following:

- the notes of the lectures,
- the Matlab/Octave code of important algorithms,
- the (pseudo)code of the exercise.

In the future, I intend to migrate the project into Python language.
